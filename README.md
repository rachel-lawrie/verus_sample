# Sample Code from Verus

The following repositories contain a selection of code I wrote at Verus as one of three founding engineers. The functionality outlined here represents just a small part of a much larger codebase.  

To provide context on how this code was originally structured and developed, Iâ€™ve maintained the same multi-repository setup and Docker-based environment used in the full application. This approach offers insight into both the code itself and the development environment I designed.  

While these repositories do not include the entire system, they demonstrates a piece of my contribution, coding style, and approach to building scalable software.
