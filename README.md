# Sample Code from Verus

The following repositories contain a selection of code I wrote at Verus as one of three founding engineers. The functionality outlined here represents just a small part of a much larger codebase.

- https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_shared
- https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_backend_core
- https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_app_backend
- https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_cockpit_backend


To provide context on how this code was originally structured and developed, Iâ€™ve maintained the same multi-repository setup and Docker-based environment used in the full application. This approach offers insight into both the code itself and the development environment I designed.  

While these repositories do not include the entire system, they demonstrates a piece of my contribution, coding style, and approach to building scalable software.  

## Run the app locally using Docker
First download docker desktop and make sure it is open.

Note that there is shared code that is used by the app and cockpit backends stored in the library at https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_backend_core.

### shared
Monitoring, database container

Download repo: https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_shared
Delete go.sum
Run `go mod tidy` to get rid of errors.

Run the following commands to start the shared services:
```bash

docker network create shared-network
docker-compose -f docker-compose-shared.dev.yml build --no-cache  
docker-compose -f docker-compose-shared.dev.yml up --remove-orphans
```
- To reload the container without rebuilding: 
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart app
```

**Database**
A mongodb container is launched as part of the docker set up.

To access database commands in IDE:

Run the following (in this example it is mongodb-container (replace with relevant name if needed))
```bash
docker exec -it mongodb-container mongosh -u admin -p adminpassword
```

- Identify database container name.
```bash
docker ps
```
### verus_app_backend
Core platform logic, such as API endpoints that our customers would access to upload applicants, the connection to the Compliance vendors, and the business logic to provide responses.

Download repo: https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_app_backend
Delete go.sum
Run `go mod tidy` to get rid of errors.

Create a .env file in the repository using the .env.example file as a template. Copy db username and password from shared/docker-compose-shared.dev.yml. Add your own AWS credentials. For testing in development, you can put a placeholder value for the webhook secret key.

Run the following to start the server:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build --no-cache  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --remove-orphans
```
### verus_cockpit_backend
Backend logic for the dashboard. Customers can login to the dashboard to generate an API key and view their applicants.

Download repo: https://github.com/rachel-lawrie/verus_cockpit_backend
Delete go.sum
Run `go mod tidy` to get rid of errors.

Create a .env file in the repository using the .env.example file as a template. Copy db username and password from shared/docker-compose-shared.dev.yml. Add your own AWS credentials. For testing in development, you can put a placeholder value for the webhook secret key.

Run the following to start the server:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build --no-cache  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --remove-orphans
```

### Tests to run
**Make sure main app is running. You should see "The server is up and working.**
```
curl http://localhost:8080/
```
**Make sure the cockpit backend is running. You should see "The server is up and working."**
```
curl http://localhost:8000/cockpit/
```
- Create a client (customer of Verus)
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/cockpit/v1/clients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"company_name": "TEST_COMPANY_NAME"}'
```
Record the client_id from the response.

**Generate an API key for the client, using the client_id from the previous step in the request body and a chosen name for the key.**
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/cockpit/v1/secrets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": "TEST_CLIENT_ID",
    "environment": "dev",
    "name": "TEST_NAME_OF_KEY"
  }'
```
Record the api_key from the response.

**Create an applicant, using the api_key from the previous step in the header.**
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/protected/applicants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "TEST_FIRST_NAME",
    "middle_name": "TEST_MIDDLE_NAME",
    "last_name": "TEST_LAST_NAME",
    "email": "TEST_EMAIL",
    "phone": "TEST_PHONE",
    "address": {
      "line1": "TEST_LINE1",
      "line2": "TEST_LINE2",
      "city": "TEST_CITY",
      "region": "TEST_REGION",
      "postal_code": "TEST_POSTAL_CODE",
      "country": "TEST_COUNTRY"
    },
    "dob": "TEST_DOB",
    "level": "Basic KYC"
  }'
```
For example:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/protected/applicants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: 71a43e06199c6cf6533b3317f977bc62" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",
    "middle_name": "Mark",
    "last_name": "Marly",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "address": {
      "line1": "123 Main St",
      "line2": "Apt 4B",
      "city": "Springfield",
      "region": "IL",
      "postal_code": "62704",
      "country": "USA"
    },
    "dob": "1990-02-01",
    "level": "Basic KYC"
  }'
```
When the request is made, personally identifying information is encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) before it is stored at rest. See CreateApplicant function in verus_app-backend/internal/applicant/controllers/applicant_controller.go and backend-core/utils/kmsuploader.go and backend-core/utils/encryption.go for the logic.

You can then view the stored client, secret (hashed) and applicant in the database either through the IDE (described above) or MongoDB Compass.
