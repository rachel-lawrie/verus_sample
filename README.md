# Sample Code from Verus

The following repositories contain a selection of code I wrote at Verus as one of three founding engineers. The functionality outlined here represents just a small part of a much larger codebase.

To provide context on how this code was originally structured and developed, Iâ€™ve maintained the same multi-repository setup and Docker-based environment used in the full application. This approach offers insight into both the code itself and the development environment I designed.  

While these repositories do not include the entire system, they demonstrates a piece of my contribution, coding style, and approach to building scalable software.  

### shared - monitoring, database container

From the shared folder, run the following commands to start the shared services:
```bash

docker network create shared-network
docker-compose -f docker-compose-shared.dev.yml build --no-cache  
docker-compose -f docker-compose-shared.dev.yml up --remove-orphans
```
- To reload the container without rebuilding: 
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart app
```

**Database**
A mongodb container is launched as part of the docker set up.

To access database commands in IDE:

Run the following (in this example it is mongodb-container (replace with relevant name if needed))
```bash
docker exec -it mongodb-container mongosh -u admin -p adminpassword
```

- Identify database container name.
```bash
docker ps
```
